Input capture is a feature of the Nucleo F446RE board that allows the board to measure the duration of an incoming signal.  
This is accomplished by using one of the board's built-in timers to measure the time between the rising or falling edge of an external signal and the corresponding interrupt.  
To set up input capture on the Nucleo F446RE board, you will need to configure the timer, the input capture channel, and the interrupt.
Here are the basic steps:  
1)Enable the timer you want to use for input capture. You can choose from one of the four timers available on the board.
2)Configure the timer to run in input capture mode. This can typically be done by setting the timer's control registers appropriately.
3)Choose the input capture channel that you want to use. Each timer has multiple input capture channels that can be used to measure different signals.
4)Configure the input capture channel to trigger an interrupt on the rising or falling edge of the incoming signal.
5)Write an interrupt service routine to handle the interrupt generated by the input capture channel.
Once input capture is set up, you can use it to measure the duration of an incoming signal. For example, if you are measuring the duration of a pulse, you can use input capture to determine the time between the rising edge of the pulse and the falling edge. This can be useful in a wide range of applications, such as measuring the speed of a motor or the frequency of a signal.
