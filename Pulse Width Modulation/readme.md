Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) is a technique used to control the average voltage or current supplied to a load by varying the duty cycle of a square wave signal. The Nucleo F446RE board, based on the STM32F446RE microcontroller, supports PWM functionality.  

To use PWM on the Nucleo F446RE board, you can configure one of the microcontroller's timers to generate PWM signals. The board offers several timers, such as TIM1, TIM2, TIM3, etc., each with multiple channels capable of generating PWM signals.  

Here's a general procedure to enable PWM on the Nucleo F446RE board:  

   Select a suitable timer and channel that supports PWM.
   Enable the clock for the chosen timer.
   Configure the timer's mode and period to determine the PWM signal frequency.
   Configure the channel for PWM output mode.
   Set the pulse width by updating the channel's capture/compare register (CCR) with a value between 0 and the timer's period.
   
By adjusting the pulse width (duty cycle) in the CCR, you can control the average voltage or current supplied to the load.  
A shorter pulse width results in lower average voltage or current, while a longer pulse width increases it.  

Once the PWM is configured, the Nucleo F446RE board will generate the desired PWM signal on the specified pin. You can connect the load (e.g., a motor, LED, or servo) to this pin to control its behavior.
